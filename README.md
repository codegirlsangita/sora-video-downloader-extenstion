- Use the raw URL to embed images anywhere (or to let users fetch manifest/content.js directly).

# Final checklist before publishing on GitHub
- [ ] Replace `<USERNAME>` and `<REPO>` in README and anywhere else.
- [ ] Add `screenshot.png` (a 1200Ã—675 PNG looks nice for previews) to repo root.
- [ ] Update `LICENSE` with your name/year.
- [ ] Add a clear README `description` and tags on GitHub (topics: `chrome-extension`, `video`, `downloader`, `sora`).
- [ ] Add `.gitignore` if needed (node modules, etc).

If you want I can:
- generate the final **README.md** file in the exact repo format (I can create it for you here), or
- produce a ready-to-paste `screenshot.png` placeholder and a recommend visual style for the image, or
- create a polished `README` with badges and a demo GIF (if you provide a GIF or screenshot).

Which of those next steps would you like? ðŸ˜Š
